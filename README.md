WE Share - A Medicine Crowd-Sourcing Initiative

The basic concept behind this idea is to share the extra medicines available with us in our local neighbourhood so that people need not loose their quarantine while accessing their essential medication and reduce medical waste.


Medi Share - Your all Time Medicine Assistant

Medi_Share will be one in all app to keep in track of all your medicine, generously share your extra available dosage and indeed provide a platform to buy those medicine from the local neighbourhood. This feature rich app will stand helpful not only during this time of the
pandemic but also will solve a bigger problem of every household by providing medicine to economically weaker people at half of the original cost.
